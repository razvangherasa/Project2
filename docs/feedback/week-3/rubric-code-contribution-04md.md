# Code Contributions and Code Reviews


#### Focused Commits

Grade: Good

Feedback: Well-done!


#### Isolation

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: Keep the naming style of the branches consistent. There are multiple styles currently used. Branches should be named with a clear short name which relates to the feature being developed in the branch. From the existing branches it does not seem that the group consistently uses feature branches/merge requests to isolate individual features during development. 


#### Reviewability

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: Include a description in all your merge requests, that would make it easier to review your merge requests. Good that the merge requests are usually small and with few commits! That make them very reviewable.


#### Code Reviews

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: There is some but limited code review work being done in the merge requests. Even if you have no feedback be explicit. Please review the slides on Project Management from week 1.


#### Build Server

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: Missing 10+ checkstyle rules.
